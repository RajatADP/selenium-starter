## Project Description

This is a sample project that demonstrates the usage of Pact JVM for consumer-driven contract testing in a Java application. It showcases how to create pact tests, generate contract files, and verify them against a provider.

The project is built using Java and the following technologies:

- [Pact JVM](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-jvm): A JVM implementation of the Pact specification for contract testing.
- [JUnit](https://junit.org/): A unit testing framework for Java.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): A build automation tool for Java projects.

## Business Flow

This is a credit card delivering application where we have a consumer(**creditCard**) and a provider(**creditCheck**) build using [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework. 


For demonstrating contract test we are using a basic application where **creditCheck** service will return credit score as HIGH when it receives **citizenNumber** as 1 from **creditCard** service and returns credit score as LOW when it receives **citizenNumber** as 2.

According to response **creditCard** service will return credit card **GRANTED** or **DENIED** to user.
